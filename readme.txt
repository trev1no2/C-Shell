//----- C-Shell -----//
By Juan Manuel Trevino

Purpose - The purpose of this project is to begin transitioning from post
CS3157 (Advanced Programming at Columbia University) to explore concepts
and projects that I find quite interesting! In writing a C-Shell, I will 
be recapping concepts covered in the course and gain the confidence to 
tackle a larger project such as writing a compiler or an operating system!

//----- How to use this Shell -----//

//----- Timeline -----//
01/07/21 - I finally set up the dev environment I will be working in. To
best replicate both my environment at work and in 3157, I set up a
raspberiry pi running raspian and am SSH'ing into the pi.
